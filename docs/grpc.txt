gRPC documentation
==================

I. Where to find the code

The code is in ./modules/grpc_api directory.

II. How to pull or deploy

You can pull Docker container from okaxel:udaconnect-grpc-api:latest

You can deploy it with the file ./deployment/udaconnect-grpc-api.yaml directly.

To avoid errors it is recommended to deploy other parts as well especially
ZooKeeper and Kafka.

III. How to connect

The gRPC serice runs on port 5005 in the localhost. You can copy the direct link
localhost:5005 from here.

In fact the nodeport is accessible on port 30003 if you deploced it like
mentioned in the II. part. In this case you can use the link localhost:30003
simply.

IV. How to send a sample/test message

You can test gRPC server in two ways.

IV.1. The easy way

It is a question of habit which one is the easiest way but I guess to run the
code drictly is much more easy than using it as a deployed container in
kubernetes, k3s, k8s or wherever. In case if you select this solution you
need a convenient environment and two terminals only.

In the first terminal run:
flask run --host 0.0.0.0

In the second terminal run
python sample_message.py

IV.2. The hard way

If you want to try the deployed container. You have to step into the container
and run:
python sample_message.py

Thats it.
